    "### What is a Repository?\n",
    "A **repository** (or \"repo\") is a folder that Git tracks. It contains:\n",
    "- Your code/notebooks\n",
    "- A hidden `.git/` folder (Git's brain — don't touch it!)\n",
    "- A `.gitignore` file (tells Git what to ignore)\n",

    "**Way 2: Create locally, push to GitHub** (more advanced, skip for now)\n",
